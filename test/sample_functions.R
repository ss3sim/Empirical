#' Sample empirial weight-at-age data and write to file for use by the EM.
#'
#' @details Take a \code{data.SS_new} file containing expected values and sample
#' from true ages to get realistic proportions for the number of fish in
#' each age bin, then use the mean size-at-age and CV for growth to
#' generate random samples of size, which are then converted to weight and
#' averaged to get mean weight-at-age values. These values are then written
#' to file for the EM. By calling this function, \code{ss3sim} will turn on
#' the empirical weight-at-age function (set maturity option to 5)
#' automatically. See \link{\code{ss3sim_base}} for more details on how
#' that is implemented.
